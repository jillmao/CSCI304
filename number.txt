(1) Suppose num1 and num2 are unsigned numbers (more precisely, unsigned char), what are they in decimal representation? 
    num1 = 237
    num2 = 128

(2) Suppose they are signed numbers (more precisely, signed char) in two's complement representation, what are they in decimal representation?
    num1 = -19
    num2 = -128
    
(3) Suppose an integer is represented in 4 bytes. Write the two's complement representation for number 157 and -157 in hexadecimal form.
    157 = 0x0000009b
    -157 = 0xffffff63

(4) Convert 10001001 in binary to decimal (under the unsigned number representation) and hexadecimal.
    decimal: 137
    hexadecimal: 0x89

(5) Convert 35 in decimal to binary and hexadecimal.
    binary: 00100011
    hexadecimal:0x23

(6) Again we use 8-bit numbers. Calculate (-122)+(-111), 111+122, and 111-122 by using two's complement representations and addition in binary. Indicate whether overflow occurs.  
    (-122)+(-111): overflow occurs
    111+122: overflow does not occur
    111-122: overflow does not occur
